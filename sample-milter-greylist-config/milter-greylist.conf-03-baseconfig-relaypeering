### If you work with multiple MX, list them with peer entries to enable
### the greylist contents sync among the MX.
### For older milter-greylist, the peer list should except THIS CURRENT server.
### Newer milter-greylist auto-excludes itself if it can, so the list may be
### shared among all MXes. However, for multihomed hosts individual configs
### may be preferred.

# You may wish to use a specific local address or port for 
# syncing between MXes. Of course one of your interfaces 
# must have the address assigned. An '*' for the address 
# means any address. Default port 5252/tcp.

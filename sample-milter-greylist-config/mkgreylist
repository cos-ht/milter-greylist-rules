### Combine milter-greylist configuration file snippets into a common file
### named /etc/mail/greylist.conf (completely replaced in the process).
### NOTE: This script tries to validate the temporary config file and then
### compares it to the existing config. If the newly built one is valid and
### identical to old, no changes are done and an exit code of 126 is returned.
### NOTE: There is a fair bit of hard-coding (paths etc.) as was applicable
### for our internally produced packages.

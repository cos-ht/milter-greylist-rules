racl continue \
    set $contact="bypass-antispam@myorg.domain" \
    set $repost="repost from registered SMTP server, or contact %P{contact}"

racl whitelist rcpt bypass-antispam@myorg.domain log "MGL-WHITELIST-RCPT: %P{conninfo}: static-whitelisted by rule %a, delay %R"

### Alas, this syntax is not yet supported (4.5.7):
#racl whitelist rcpt "%P{contact}" log "MGL-WHITELIST-RCPT: %P{conninfo}: static-whitelisted by rule %a, delay %R"
#racl whitelist rcpt %P{contact} log "MGL-WHITELIST-RCPT: %P{conninfo}: static-whitelisted by rule %a, delay %R"

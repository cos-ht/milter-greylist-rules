### This part of the split-config declares the multi-relay common basic config.
### It is unlikely to change from packaged version; however, if change does
### come - it should be simultaneous on all hosts.

# Greylisting your own MTA is a very bad idea: never
# comment this line, except for testing purposes.
racl whitelist addr 127.0.0.0/8

# If you use IPv6, uncomment this.
#racl whitelist addr ::1/128

################# EXAMPLES, actual rules set in other split config files #####
# You will want to avoid greylisting your own clients
# as well, by filtering out your IP address blocks.
# Here is an example if you use 192.0.2.0/16.
#racl whitelist addr 192.0.2.0/16

# It is also possible to whitelist sender
# machines using their DNS names.
#racl whitelist domain example.net

# You can avoid greylisting by filtering on the sender
# envelope address, but this is not a good idea: it
# can be trivially forged.
#racl whitelist from friendly@example.com

# Some of your users do not get any spam because
# their addresses have never been collected by
# spammers. They will want to avoid the extra delivery
# delay caused by grey listing. You can filter on the
# recipient envelope address to achieve that.
#racl whitelist rcpt John.Doe@example.net

# It is possible to use regular expressions in domain, from
# and rcpt lines. The expression must be enclosed by
# slashes (/). Note that no escaping is available to
# provide slashes inside the regular expression.
#racl whitelist rcpt /@example\.net$/
########################## END OF RULE EXAMPLE SYNTAX #############

# This option tells milter-greylist when it should
# add an X-Greylist header. Default is all, which
# causes a header to always be added. Other possible
# values are none, delays and nodelays
report all

# This option attempts to make milter-greylist more
# friendly with sender callback systems. When the
# message is from <>, it will be temporarily
# rejected at the DATA stage instead of the RCPT
# stage of the SMTP transaction. In the case of a
# multi recipient DSN, whitelisted recipient will
# not be honoured.
#delayedreject

# Uncomment if you want auto-whitelist to work for
# the IP rather than for the (IP, sender, receiver)
# tuple.
lazyaw

# match on subdomain boundaries instead of the default suffix
# matching. E.g. if domainexact is not enabled (the default)
# then gle.com will match google.com in addtion to gle.com.
# If domainexact is enabled then, domain names will match on
# subdomain boundaries (e.g. gle.com will match mail.gle.com
# and gle.com but not google.com)
domainexact

# How long will the greylist database retain tuples.

# Do not use ${greylist} macros from sendmail's access DB.

# Use extended regular expressions instead of basic
# regular expressions.

# All of the following options have command-line equivalents.
# See greylist.conf(5) for the exact equivalences.
#

# How long a client has to wait before we accept
# the messages it retries to send. Here, 1 hour.
# May be overridden by the "-w greylist_delay" command line argument.
### In COS&HT setups, the default delay is minimal for little disruption to
### end-users. Instead, sources that score a higher spam-source probability
### are delayed much more (2-8 hours).
#greylist 1h
#greylist 25m
greylist 2m

# How long does auto-whitelisting last (set it to 0
# to disable auto-whitelisting). Here, 3 days.
# May be overridden by the "-a autowhite_delay" command line argument.
#autowhite 3d
autowhite 3d

# Specify the netmask to be used when checking IPv4 addresses
# in the greylist.
# May be overridden by the "-L cidrmask" command line argument.
#subnetmatch /24

# Specify the netmask to be used when checking IPv6 addresses
# in the greylist.
# May be overridden by the "-M prefixlen" command line argument.
#subnetmatch6 /64

# Normally, clients that succeed SMTP AUTH are not
# greylisted. Uncomment this if you want to
# greylist them regardless of SMTP AUTH.
# May be overridden by the "-A" command line argument.
### In COS&HT setups, AUTH'd relays are separate from common ones
### There are spammers who use "AUTH=<>" to bypass milter-greylist
noauth

# If milter-greylist was built with SPF support, then
# SPF-compliant senders are not greylisted. Uncomment
# this to greylist them regardless of SPF compliance.
# May be overridden by the "-S" command line argument.
### In COS&HT setups, SPF processing is one of many factors in greylisting,
### rules are detailed below in the modular configuration
#nospf

# Uncomment this to disable DRAC
#nodrac

# Uncomment this if you do not want milter-greylist
# to tell its clients how long they are greylisted.
# May be overridden by the "-q" command line argument.
#quiet

# Here is an example of user preference pulled from a LDAP directory
# (requires building --with-libcurl). If the milterGreylistStatus 
# attribute is set to TRUE, then $usrRBL will be usable later in the
# ACL and will carry the values of the usrRBL attribute.
# urlcheck "userpref" \
# "ldap://localhost/dc=example,dc=net?milterGreylistStatus,usrRBL?one?mail=%r" \
# 30 getprop clear fork

# If the p0f socket is defined, fingerprinting (and possible related delays)
# take place before any ACL processing. The 'acl p0f' rules only process the
# cached results of the query to the p0f daemon, if any are available.
#p0fsock "/var/milter-greylist/p0f.sock"
